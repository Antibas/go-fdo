# FIDO Device Onboard - Go Library

`go-fdo` is a lightweight stdlib-only library for implementing FDO device, owner service, and device initialization server roles.

It implements [FIDO Device Onboard Specification 1.1][fdo] as well as necessary dependencies such as [CBOR][cbor] and [COSE][cose]. Implementations of dependencies are not meant to be complete implementations of their relative specifications, but are supported and any breaking changes to their APIs will be considered a breaking change to `go-fdo`.
